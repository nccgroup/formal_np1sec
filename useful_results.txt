I developed a way to handle xors while keeping term rewriting bounded (convergent?).
See anchored-xors-proof-by-hand.txt for the reasoning behind this technique.

The technique is implemented and tested in `normalized-xorm-useful-nozero.spthy`.

The technique is then applied to a simplified version of the np1sec protocol in
gkep_normxorm_simplified_cleaned.spthy and gkep_normxorm_simplified.spthy.

Note that the fact that the proof that the simplified version implies secrecy
of the group shared key in the general case for a three-party gkex is
nontrivial and still needs to be written up.

Furthermore, the proof by induction on number of participants needs further
consideration.
